## Running the Kotlin scripts

A unix base OS is recommended.

- Install `kscript`
- Go into this directory (kotlin/)
- `$ chmod +x puzzle<Day>.kt`
- `$ kscript puzzle<Day>.kt` or just ` $ ./puzzle<Day>.kt`

## Disclaimer
The Kotlin-Scripts are made in a "quick and dirty" fashion. But no shringking master-race.

Also, since (at least on my computer) the kotlin release seems outdated, some of the syntax sugar is missing.
